#ifndef PORT_CHARA_H
#define PORT_CHARA_H

/* PC build: characters added from outside the disc (port/src/plat_charas.c).
 *
 * The disc has 161 characters, ids 0x00..0xA0, and the menus use 0xA1..0xA4 as markers (random, locked, custom,
 * empty), in the disc's data as well as in the code. An added character has an id from 0xC6: below 0x100 (from
 * there the battle takes an id for an object), not 0xFF ("none" in the byte-sized form lists), and with a bit in
 * the 192-bit unlock field.
 *
 * Two things hang on a character id:
 * - file ids. Every rule (`0x590 + id * 10 + n` for the models, `0xBDA + id` for the voice bank, ...) is packed
 *   for 161 characters: the id after the last character's is the first of the next kind of file. An added
 *   character's own files (models, animations, effects, voice banks) have ids past the end of the second
 *   archive, which the port answers from the character's folder.
 * - tables of 161 rows in the common files (health and ki, cost, costumes, AI type, links) and of 161 entries in
 *   every character's own file (what is said to which opponent), and the streamed voice lines. For these an
 *   added character stands as its BASE character, one of the disc's.
